# evm
Eulerian Video Magnification

Inspired by Wu et al. 2012 this is a work in progress recreation of the original Eulerian Video Magnificaiton paper written in Python 3.4.

## installation

First make sure to have docker installed. Then run the following.

```git clone https://github.com/TimothyStiles/evm.git && cd evm && sh build```

From there you should be able to run ```docker run -it evm bash''' and play around in an environment that already contains all the tricky dependencies you need to have with opencv.
